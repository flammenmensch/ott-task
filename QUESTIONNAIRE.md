# Questionnaire

Among different achievements during my career I think I could emphasize the following ones.

The first one was the development of a framework for developing ATM applications using Flash Platform at QIWI PLC company.
The first version developed by my predecessor had too many bugs and was completely unsupportable, so I had to write my
 own implementation from scratch. The challenge here was to create highly maintainable library which could prevent the team from common mistakes and would also reduce development time.
 As a result we managed to build a dozen of different application using the new framework.
 The average time of the development of a new application was about 1-2 weeks and mostly consisted of the implementation of application-specific features and applying new designs.
 
The second achievement was also during my career in QIWI. It was when I had to choose a server technology for our social platform so we could develop our server apps independently from Java developers.
I chose Node.js and had to learn it really quick, so we could start developing as soon as possible. As a result we build three server-side applications. All of them were sharing single code base for three social networks (Facebook, VKontakte and Odnoklassniki).

The third project I'm very proud of is the Hotspot editor (codename Linker) which I also had to develop from scratch during my work in Megavisor. This application allowed users
 to place active spots upon interactive animations and panoramic images, so the visitors could click on them and navigate between different content (virtual tours).
 This task involved different challenges such as working with Bezier curves, so that hotspots could follow the moving objects and vector maths to project hotspots from 3d space to the screen in panoramic images.
 The development was done in close interaction with our CEO and photographers and in the end everybody was satisfied with the result.
 
Speaking of new techniques and frameworks, I think I'd like to continue improving my skills in Javascript/HTML5. Mobile Devices also give web developers very exciting opportunities to use such technologies as device motion, accelerometer integration, geolocation, camera, etc.
I'd also like to try React.js library in some of the real-life projects. Also the more I read about functional programming the more I like it. Thus I'd like to try RxJS or Bacon.js libraries as well.
